# Astro

Some programs I've written using PyEphem. It's not a package to be installed,
more a collection of toys and experiments I've done with PyEphem.

The PyEphem home page is <http://rhodesmill.org/pyephem/>

I'm using the [package built for Python 3, called ephem instead of PyEphem.](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/ephem/)

The [Requests package](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/user/install/) is used to get the latest space station and comet data.
