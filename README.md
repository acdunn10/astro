No one should be trying to watch this repo. It's undergoing many
changes and is very unstable.

As of June 2015, experimenting with skyfield:
    pip install skyfield

As of January 2014, this repo is a mess. I'm going to see if I can revive it. It's still not worth watching. I'm moving everything into the 'obsolete' folder, then will start pulling stuff back that's worth keeping.

Some programs I've written using PyEphem. It's not a package to be installed,
more a collection of toys and experiments I've done with PyEphem.

The PyEphem home page is <http://rhodesmill.org/pyephem/>

I'm using the [package built for Python 3, called ephem instead of PyEphem.](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/ephem/)

The [Requests package](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/user/install/) is used to get the latest space station and comet data.
