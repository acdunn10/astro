"""
    When does sunrise become visible from my north-facing building?

    My building faces north and my view to the east is blocked by
    another tall building a block or two away. The leftmost edge
    of that building is at a compass direction of 78Â°, so I do not
    see any sunrises until the Sun rises to the left of that
    building.

    On which day in the spring does the Sun finally rise left of
    the building? And what is the last day that a sunrise will
    be visible?
